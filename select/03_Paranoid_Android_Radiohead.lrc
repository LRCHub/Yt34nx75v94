[00:18.98] Please could you stop the noise?
[00:22.52] I'm trying to get some rest
[00:36.02] 
[00:36.43] From all the unborn chicken
[00:40.84] Voices in my head
[00:49.34] 
[00:50.04] What's that?
[01:04.82] (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
[01:05.45] What's that?
[01:06.48] (I may be paranoid, but not an android)
[01:25.98] 
[01:09.23] When I am king
[01:11.56] You will be first against the wall
[01:28.56] 
[01:26.45] With your opinion
[01:29.80] Which is of no consequence at all
[01:46.30] 
[01:40.02] What's that?
[01:50.36] (I may be paranoid, but no android)
[01:52.77] What's that?
[01:54.65] (I may be paranoid, but no android)
[02:12.15] 
[02:20.37] Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
[02:26.20] Kicking and squealing Gucci little piggy
[02:46.20] 
[02:31.87] You don't remember, you don't remember
[02:44.64] Why don't you remember my name?
[02:48.31] Off with his head, man
[02:50.07] Off with his head, man
[02:51.75] Why don't you remember my name?
[02:53.43] I guess he does
[03:00.93] 
[05:27.40] Rain down, rain down
[05:28.46] Come on rain down on me
[05:29.51] From a great height
[05:30.88] From a great height
[05:31.92] Height
[05:32.87] Rain down, rain down
[05:33.48] Come on rain down on me
[05:34.39] From a great height
[05:34.68] From a great height
[05:36.41] Height
[05:37.13] Rain down, rain down
[05:37.72] Come on rain down on me
[05:38.81] That's it, sir
[05:40.08] You're leaving
[06:02.01] The crackle of pigskin
[06:02.85] The dust and the screaming
[06:03.85] The yuppies networking
[06:04.76] The panic, the vomit
[06:05.36] The panic, the vomit
[06:06.98] God loves his children
[06:07.43] God loves his children, yeah
