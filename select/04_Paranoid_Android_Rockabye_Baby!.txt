Please Could You Stop The Noises I'm Trying To Get Some Rest
From All The Unborn Chicken Voices In My Head
What's That? (My Name Is Paranoid I Am Your Android)
What's That? (My Name Is Paranoid I Am Your Android)
When I Am King You Will Be First Against The Wall
With Your Opinion Which Is Of No Consequence At All
What's That? (My Name Is Paranoid I Am Your Android)
What's That? (My Name Is Paranoid I Am Your Android)
Ambition Makes You Look Pretty Ugly
Kicking Squealing Gucci Little Piggy
You Don't Remember
You Don't Remember
Why Don't You Remember My Name?
Off With His Head Man
Off With His Head Man
Why Won't He Remember My Name? I Guess He Does
Rain Down
Rain Down
Come On Rain Down
On Me
From A Great Height
From A Great Height Height
Rain Down
Rain Down
Come On Rain Down
On Me
From A Great Height
From A Great Height Height
(Repeats 3rd Time Underneath Vocals Are:)
That's It Sir
You're Leaving
The Crackle Of Pig Skin
The Dust And The Screaming
The Yuppies Networking
The Panic The Vomit
The Panic The Vomit
God Loves His Children
God Loves His Children Yeah
